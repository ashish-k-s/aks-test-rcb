#  The Command-Line Assistant Powered by RHEL Lightspeed

The Command-Line Assistant Powered by RHEL Lightspeed is an optional AI tool embedded within the RHEL command-line interface. It leverages information from Red Hat Knowledge Centered Service (KCS) articles, RHEL documentation, and other resources to assist users. Key functionalities include answering RHEL-related questions, troubleshooting and fixing issues, interpreting log files, and providing recommendations. This assistant supports interactive workflows for issue resolution, feature implementation, and information retrieval. It's crucial to note that the assistant does not have direct access to system information; instead, it guides users with relevant commands to gather necessary details. The assistant adheres to the RHEL lifecycle and supports specific versions as per Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle policies.
